# polytope-docs

This repository combines the Sphinx documentation from polytope-server, polytope-client and polytope-deployment into a single project, suitable for pushing to readthedocs.

:warning: This project is BETA and will be experimental for the forseable future. Interfaces and functionality are likely to change, and the project itself may be scrapped. DO NOT use this software in any project/software that is operational.
